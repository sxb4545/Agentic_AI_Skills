# Hour 1 Exercises: Embeddings & Similarity Search

## Exercise 1: Change the Search Query (Easy)

**Task**: Modify the demo to search for a different type of issue.

**In the demo code, find this line** (around line 103):
```python
query = "Users can't login after changing password"
```

**Change it to**:
```python
query = "Database is running very slowly"
```

**Run the demo and observe**:
- Do the top results match the new query?
- What categories do the matching tickets belong to?

> **Answer (Assignment 2):** Yes, the top results match. For `"Database is running very slowly"` the top hits are:
> `#1 0.5246 [Performance] Dashboard loading extremely slowly` and `#2 0.4511 [Database] Database connection timeout in production`.
> The matching tickets belong to the **Performance** and **Database** categories — exactly the topics implied by the query, even though the wording differs (semantic, not keyword, match).

**Try these queries too**:
- `"Payment failed for international customer"`
- `"Mobile app keeps crashing"`
- `"Emails are not being delivered"`

---

## Exercise 2: Adjust the Number of Results (Easy)

**Task**: Get more search results by changing top_k.

**In the demo code, find this line** (around line 137):
```python
top_k = 5
```

**Change it to**:
```python
top_k = 10
```

**Run the demo and answer**:
- At what rank does the similarity score drop below 0.5?
- Are results #8, #9, #10 still relevant to your query?
- What's the similarity score of result #10?

> **Answer (Assignment 2):** (query = `"Database is running very slowly"`)
> - The score drops below 0.5 at **rank #2** (`#1 = 0.5246`, `#2 = 0.4511`). Only the #1 result clears the 0.5 bar.
> - Results #8, #9, #10 are **only weakly relevant** — scores ~0.27 and topics drift (API, Authentication, Performance). They are returned only because `top_k=10` forces 10 results.
> - Similarity score of result #10 = **0.2719** (TICK-005, Memory leak in background worker).
> - **Takeaway:** a large `top_k` returns low-quality tail results; pair it with a similarity threshold (Exercise 3).

---

## Exercise 3: Add a Similarity Threshold (Easy)

**Task**: Only show results above a certain similarity score.

**Find the results loop in the demo** (around line 145):
```python
for rank, idx in enumerate(top_indices, 1):
    ticket = tickets[idx]
    score = similarities[idx]
    
    print(f"\n#{rank} - Similarity: {score:.4f}")
    # ... rest of printing
```

**Add one line to skip low-scoring results**:
```python
for rank, idx in enumerate(top_indices, 1):
    ticket = tickets[idx]
    score = similarities[idx]
    
    # ADD THIS LINE: Skip results below threshold
    if score < 0.5:
        continue
    
    print(f"\n#{rank} - Similarity: {score:.4f}")
    # ... rest of printing
```

**Test with**:
- A relevant query (should show results)
- An unrelated query like `"How to make pizza"` (should show fewer/no results)

> **Answer (Assignment 2):** With the `0.5` threshold, `"Database is running very slowly"` shows exactly **1 result** (Dashboard loading extremely slowly, 0.5245), and `"How to make pizza"` shows **0 results** — every ticket scores below 0.5. This confirms the threshold correctly filters out unrelated queries.

---

## Exercise 4: Compare Two Queries (Easy)

**Task**: See how the same tickets rank differently for different queries.

**Add this code at the end of the demo** (after PART 5):
```python
# Compare two queries
query1 = "Login authentication failed"
query2 = "Slow database performance"

print("\n" + "="*80)
print("COMPARING TWO QUERIES")
print("="*80)

for q in [query1, query2]:
    response = client.embeddings.create(input=[q], model=embedding_model)
    q_emb = np.array([response.data[0].embedding])
    sims = cosine_similarity(q_emb, embeddings)[0]
    top_idx = np.argmax(sims)
    
    print(f"\nQuery: '{q}'")
    print(f"  Best match: {tickets[top_idx]['title']}")
    print(f"  Score: {sims[top_idx]:.4f}")
```

**Run it and observe**: Do the queries find appropriate tickets?

> **Answer (Assignment 2):** Yes. `"Login authentication failed"` → best match *Users unable to log in after password reset* (0.4616); `"Slow database performance"` → best match *Dashboard loading extremely slowly* (0.5088). Each query lands on a semantically appropriate ticket.

## Exercise 5: Test Semantic Understanding (Medium)

**Task**: Verify that embeddings understand meaning, not just keywords.

**Copy this complete code into a new file** `test_semantic.py`:
```python
import numpy as np
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
model = 'text-embedding-3-small'

# These mean the SAME thing but use DIFFERENT words
texts = [
    "User authentication failed",      # Original
    "Login credentials rejected",       # Same meaning, different words
    "Cannot sign in to account",        # Same meaning, different words
    "Database connection timeout",      # DIFFERENT topic
]

# Generate embeddings
response = client.embeddings.create(input=texts, model=model)
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in response.data])

# Calculate all pairwise similarities
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings)

# Print results
print("Similarity Matrix:")
print("-" * 50)
for i, text1 in enumerate(texts):
    for j, text2 in enumerate(texts):
        if i < j:  # Only print upper triangle
            sim = similarity_matrix[i][j]
            print(f"{sim:.3f}  '{text1[:30]}...' vs '{text2[:30]}...'")
```

**Run it and answer**:
- What's the similarity between "authentication failed" and "login rejected"?
- What's the similarity between "authentication failed" and "database timeout"?
- Does this prove embeddings understand meaning, not just keywords?

> **Answer (Assignment 2):**
> - `"User authentication failed"` vs `"Login credentials rejected"` = **0.778** (high — same meaning, zero shared keywords).
> - `"User authentication failed"` vs `"Database connection timeout"` = **0.447** (much lower — different topic).
> - **Yes.** The paraphrase scores far higher than the unrelated sentence despite sharing no words, proving embeddings capture *meaning*, not surface keywords.

## Exercise 6: Filter by Category (Medium)

**Task**: Add category filtering to the search.

**Copy and complete this code** (fill in the ONE missing line):
```python
import json
import numpy as np
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
model = 'text-embedding-3-small'

# Load data
with open('../../data/synthetic_tickets.json', 'r') as f:
    tickets = json.load(f)

texts = [f"{t['title']}. {t['description']}" for t in tickets]
response = client.embeddings.create(input=texts, model=model)
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in response.data])

def search_with_category(query, category_filter=None, top_k=5):
    """Search tickets, optionally filtering by category"""
    # Get query embedding
    response = client.embeddings.create(input=[query], model=model)
    query_emb = np.array([response.data[0].embedding])
    
    # Calculate similarities
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_emb, embeddings)[0]
    
    # Get results with category filter
    results = []
    for idx in np.argsort(similarities)[::-1]:
        ticket = tickets[idx]
        
        # FILL IN THIS LINE: Skip if category doesn't match filter
        # Hint: if category_filter is set AND ticket category doesn't match, skip
        if category_filter and ticket['category'] != category_filter:
            continue
        
        results.append((ticket, similarities[idx]))
        if len(results) >= top_k:
            break
    
    return results

# Test it
print("All categories:")
for ticket, score in search_with_category("login problem"):
    print(f"  {score:.3f} [{ticket['category']}] {ticket['title']}")

print("\nOnly 'Authentication' category:")
for ticket, score in search_with_category("login problem", category_filter="Authentication"):
    print(f"  {score:.3f} [{ticket['category']}] {ticket['title']}")
```

## Exercise 7: Batch vs Single Embedding (Medium)

**Task**: Compare the speed of batch vs single API calls.

**Copy and run this code** (no changes needed - just observe the results):
```python
import time
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
model = 'text-embedding-3-small'

texts = [
    "Password reset not working",
    "Database connection timeout", 
    "App crashes on startup",
    "Payment declined error",
    "Email notifications delayed",
]

# Method 1: SLOW - One API call per text
print("Method 1: Single API calls...")
start = time.time()
for text in texts:
    response = client.embeddings.create(input=[text], model=model)
time_slow = time.time() - start
print(f"  Time: {time_slow:.2f} seconds")

# Method 2: FAST - One API call for all texts
print("\nMethod 2: Batch API call...")
start = time.time()
response = client.embeddings.create(input=texts, model=model)
time_fast = time.time() - start
print(f"  Time: {time_fast:.2f} seconds")

# Compare
print(f"\n✓ Batch is {time_slow/time_fast:.1f}x faster!")
print(f"  Always batch your embeddings in production!")
```

**Answer**: How much faster is batching for 5 texts?

> **Answer (Assignment 2):** ~**2.9x faster** in this run (single calls: 1.18s, batch: 0.40s). The gap widens dramatically with more texts because batching removes per-request network/HTTP overhead. Always batch embeddings in production.

## Bonus Exercise: Similarity Matrix Heatmap (Challenge)

**Task**: Create a visual heatmap showing how tickets relate to each other.

**This is optional** - only try if you finished the other exercises.

```python
import json
import numpy as np
import os
from openai import OpenAI
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

# Load first 10 tickets
with open('../../data/synthetic_tickets.json', 'r') as f:
    tickets = json.load(f)[:10]

# Generate embeddings
texts = [t['title'] for t in tickets]
response = client.embeddings.create(input=texts, model='text-embedding-3-small')
embeddings = np.array([data.embedding for data in response.data])

# Compute similarity matrix
sim_matrix = cosine_similarity(embeddings)

# Create heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.imshow(sim_matrix, cmap='RdYlGn', vmin=0, vmax=1)
plt.colorbar(label='Cosine Similarity')
plt.xticks(range(10), [t['ticket_id'] for t in tickets], rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.yticks(range(10), [t['ticket_id'] for t in tickets])
plt.title('Ticket Similarity Matrix')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('similarity_heatmap.png')
plt.show()
print("✓ Saved as similarity_heatmap.png")
```

## Quick Reference

### Key Code Patterns
```python
# Generate embedding for one text
response = client.embeddings.create(input=["your text"], model=model)
embedding = response.data[0].embedding

# Generate embeddings for multiple texts (batch)
response = client.embeddings.create(input=list_of_texts, model=model)
embeddings = [data.embedding for data in response.data]

# Calculate similarity
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
similarities = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], all_embeddings)[0]

# Get top K indices
top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1][:top_k]
```
